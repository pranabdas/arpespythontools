### Installation

We will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed in your system. We
can install latest stable release of **arpespytontools** from PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade arpespythontools
```

I will be using Jupyter notebook to write and execute our python codes. You can
install Jupyter Lab using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade jupyterlab
```

Launch Jupyterlab and create or open a Python 3 Notebook:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Of course, you can use any other IDE or code editor of your choice.

### Importing arpespythontools

We can import the module by `import arpespythontools as arp` so that later in
the code we can refer to the module as `arp` in short.
```python
import arpespythontools as arp
```

### Sample dataset

You can download the sample dataset used in this tutorial from [here](
